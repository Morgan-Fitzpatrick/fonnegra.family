		<p>Morgan and Adrian met almost 10 years ago. We were together for two years before introducing our wonderful son Lucas into the world and nine years before introducing our daughter. We have been through thick and thin together. We have enjoyed the family we created and work hard to give them everything they could possibly want.</p>
